	with something like "I've created this font.", because you didn't!

	Installation :
		* Windows
			Just copy the Frasto.fon file to your C:\Windows\Fonts directory
			and it should be available within the software that supports
			fixed-width (monospace) fonts.

		* Linux
			Copy the Frasto.pcf.gz to your distro's font directory and then
			update your font-cache with the proper monkey coding.

	Hope you like it.
