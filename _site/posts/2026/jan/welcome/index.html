	<p>hoi and welcome to my blog!</p>
<p>I am pretty excited to finally get this thing running, even though I have literally the most basic format ever right meow. I got the idea to start up this blog from my good friends <a class = "clickable3" target = "_blank" href = "https://taxidermycact.us/">TaxidermyCactus</a> and <a class = "clickable3" target = "_blank" href = "https://random.dog/">kekley</a>, who both, like me, have become increasingly disillusioned by bigtechTM and the &quot;new internet&quot; in general. We share a love of creativity - both physical and digital - and I am very grateful for their guidance on this project I have undertaken.</p>
<p>First things first, the original skeleton of this blogsite was made following this very helpful <a class = "clickable3" target = "_blank" href="https://cfjedimaster.github.io/eleventy-blog-guide/guide.html">guide</a>. I briefly learned some very basic html and css in my senior of highschool - which also happens to have been almost eight years ago at this point in time. So, while the coding itself is not entirely unfamiliar to me, I guess you could pretty accurately call me rusty (and unc (and chopped (chunc))).</p>
<p>I have a few visions in mind for what I want this blog to eventually look like. There are a few neocities blogs I browsed and found some inspiration from. Here they are listed below:</p>
<p><a class = "clickable3" target = "_blank" href="https://i-land.online/travel">i-land</a></p>
<p><a class = "clickable3" target = "_blank" href="https://two-reeler.com/">two-wheeler</a></p>
<p><a class = "clickable3" target = "_blank" href="https://bearsjunkjournal.neocities.org/">bearsjunkjournal</a></p>
<p>I would like to have a nice journalistic feel to the blog eventually, but I understand that this will probably take some time to figure out. As such, it's fairly likely that you, dear reader, will see this post much after its initial creation. I'll eventually like to have some tabs that showcase a large range of creations: music, art (3d and 2d), videogames. I'll also like to keep a general log of my education journey (maybe some other nontraditional student will find comfort in all my failures and eventual successes).</p>
<p>Right now, I'm listening to Welcome to Nightvale. If you haven't given it a listen yet, please do.</p>
<p>gootbye for meow,</p>

<p>ps: here's how the blog looks at this moment in time!</p>
