		<p>Hey!! You're in my house!! It's okay, I like hosting guests :3 Come on over and grab a cup of tea, I always make some extra⋆｡°✩</p>
<p>Welcome to my little alcove on the internet. I have a lot of love for a lot of hobbies and I hope this place really reflects that. For a long time, I have been trying to move away from creating for the sake of performing, and starting to once again create for creation's sake. And that started with building this right here. It isn't too easily found, but it's mine and I hope that sharing it puts even a little bit more wonder and heart into the digital world.</p>
<p>A little bit more about me: I'm currently studying astrophysics and physics, I live in the Bay Area with my beautiful and wonderful husband, I have a lovely little cat who is my entire world, and I am deeply in love with all of my friends. It has taken a long time for me to stop seeing myself as a mistake in the universe's ledger, and here I am continuing on my journey to see myself as a whole and worthy human being. While I am alive, what recourse do I have but to live?</p>
<p>I hope I am able to log many books, many artworks, many music comps, many photographs, many travels, and I hope I will reach further and further out of my comfort zone and seek out exciting and new adventures. I hope I can be a kinder person and a source of comfort to all who know me.</p>
<p>Please stay for as long as you'd like. I have some comfy couches and more tea to top you off when you need.</p>
<p>⋆｡°✩</p>
